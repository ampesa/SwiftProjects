# SwiftProjects
Here are my first swift codes. In the LearnignPlaygrounds directory 
there is an implementation of the learning codes proposed on the third edition of "Swift 4 Protocol-Oriented Programming" book 
from the author Jon Hoffman. I think this book is highly recomended for those who want to learn Swift. 
Writting this codes helps me in the way of learning the specific sintaxis of the Swift programming language and understanding
how to structure the code in a new protocol-oriented programming paradigm. 
Specially interesting is the chapter dedicated to the design patterns that allow you to write not only efficient code but easy 
mantaining it to.
